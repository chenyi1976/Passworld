### Open Source Password Safe ###

* An OpenSource iPhone App for you to store your password safely.

### Why I make this? ###

I have tried several iPhone apps, they help me to manage my personal password, including bank account, internet website account. But I never can trust them.

As a programmer, I understand how dangerous to put these sensitive information into an iPhone App. What if they upload my data to somewhere then hack my bank account?

**To trust an App to manage my account, the only way is that I can see its source code, then I am make sure there is NO backdoor or Trojan.** 

So I made this app, it is open sourced, focused on data security. 

### Focused on Security ###

This app has multi level security:

Firstly, when you open this app or activate this app from background, you must give a 4 digital pin code.

Secondly, the data is encrypted with AES ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard ).

Later, I will add more security features. For example, the mobile sms verification, so that only your iPhone can access your data.

### What's the next ###

I will publish this app to Apple App Store very soon, it will be free. I will update the download link here once it is ready.

If you are an iOS developer, you can build app by yourself in XCode.
